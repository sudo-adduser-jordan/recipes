2 tablespoons olive oil
1 small white onion, peeled and diced
2 large carrots, diced
2 celery stalks, diced
4 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup flour
5 cups chicken stock (or vegetable stock)
1 pound Yukon gold potatoes, diced into bite-sized pieces
1 pound (uncooked) boneless skinless chicken breasts, diced into bite-sized pieces
1 tablespoon curry powder
2 teaspoons garam masala
2/3 cup frozen peas
1 (15-ounce) can full-fat coconut milk (or half and half)
sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste



Sauté the veggies. Heat oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add onion and sauté for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add carrots and celery and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Add garlic and sauté for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.
Cook the flour. Add the flour and stir to combine.  Cook for 1 minute, stirring frequently.
Add next round of ingredients. Add chicken stock, potatoes, chicken, curry powder, garam masala, and stir to combine.
Simmer. Continue cooking until the soup reaches a simmer.  Reduce heat to medium-low, in order to maintain the simmer. Continue to cook for 10-15 minutes until the potatoes are tender, stirring occasionally so that the bottom of the soup does not burn.
Add final round of ingredients. Stir in the peas and coconut milk until combined.  Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed.
Serve. Serve warm, garnished with biscuits or crackers.
